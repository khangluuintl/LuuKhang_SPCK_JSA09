        This endpoint returns, by default, the cheapest available product for
        each accommodation that matches the specified search criteria.
        <br/><br/>When you apply location filters using parameters such as
        country or region id, the results are sorted by Booking.com popularity
        (top_picks) instead of price.<br/>In this case, accommodations are
        ranked in descending order of popularity, meaning higher-ranked listings
        will appear earlier in the response.
